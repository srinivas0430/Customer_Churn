#Customer_Churn

In general churn is expressed as a degree of customer in-activity or disengagement observed over a given time this manifest within the data in various forms.

We aim to complete the following for the study:
Identify and visualise which factor contributes to customer churn.

Will build prediction model that will perform the following 
•	Classify if a customer is going to churn or not.
•	Preferably and based on model performance we will choose a model that will attach a probability to churn to make it easier to customer service to target low hanging fruits in their efforts to prevent churn.

•	Data Analysis 
•	Feature Engineering 
•	Model Building using ML Algo
